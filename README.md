# Brachytherapy-Seed-Optimization-for-Prostate-Cancer
This Python project employs Pyomo to optimize radioactive seed placement in prostate cancer treatment. It minimizes healthy tissue exposure while ensuring tumor cells receive adequate radiation, addressing a key challenge in brachytherapy and demonstrating the application of optimization in medical decision-making.
